The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue with unexpected behavior when using the `:nth-child` pseudo-class with a formula that results in a negative index:

```css
ul li:nth-child(-n+3) {
  color: red;
}
```

This CSS intends to style the first three list items red. However, most browsers interpret negative indices in `:nth-child` as selecting elements from the end of the list, which is not the intended behavior.  The result might be unexpected styling depending on the browser and the number of list items.
